# Learn Impresss.js

A quick introduction/tutorial on how to use `reveal.js` to _communicate visually_!

## Why?

To create visually appealing presentations
that captivate your audience
and help to convey your message.

My main reason for learning how to use `reveal.js` is that it allows me
to _version-control_ my presentation(s) which means that others can collaborate
with history/accountability.

### _Personal_ Reason for Learning an Open Source Presentation Tool

> Improving my communication skills is one of my **_personal_ goals**:
[goals.md#3-communication](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/blob/master/goals.md#3-communication)
<br />

Being able to communicate visually in a succinct way will save _everyone_ time
and ensure that we _eliminate_ any "_confusion_".



## What?

> "_`reveal.js` is a presentation framework based on the power
of CSS3 transforms and transitions in modern browsers
and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com._" http://impress.github.io/impress.js

Or in *English*: `reveal.js` lets you build attractive and engaging presentations
using HTML, CSS & JavaScript code that can be shared as a website.

## Why `reveal.js` _instead_ of `impress.js`

While reading the `impress.js` code I spotted that
one of the features was "_inspired by_" `reveal.js`:
https://github.com/impress/impress.js/blob/525e4fc5f2c2da28323672ea7a41ac574475819f/js/impress.js#L800
As soon as I'd finished reading the `impress.js` source I realised that
it has features I _don't need_ (3D transitions)
whereas `reveal.js` has _three_ features I want:
Markdown Support, PDF export and slides.com publishing.
So I _switched_.
