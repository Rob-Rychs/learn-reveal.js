# Learn Impresss.js

A quick introduction/tutorial on how to use impress.js to _communicate visually_!

## Why?

To create visually appealing presentations that captivate your audience
and help to convey your message.

My main reason for learning how to use impress.js is that it allows me
to _version-control_ my presentation(s) which means that others can collaborate
with history/accountability.



## What?

of CSS3 transforms and transitions in modern browsers
and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com._" http://impress.github.io/impress.js

Or in *English*: impress.js lets you build attractive and engaging presentations
using HTML, CSS & JavaScript code that can be shared as a website.
